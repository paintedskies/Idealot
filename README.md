# Idealot

### Welcome!
Idealot is a web app powered by NASA WorldWind which helps you choose a suitable country to live in by visualising data sets.

### Open Datasets
We use datasets from trusted sources. The data sets currently used are:

| Data Set | Source |
| ------ | ------ |
| Forest Area: % of Land Area (2015) | [World Bank][WB] |
| WHO/UNICEF JMP Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG baseline | [UNICEF][UNI] |
| Pollution Index for Country 2018 Mid-Year | [Numbeo][Num] |
| Temperature: Version 2 | [WorldClim][WC] |

### Tech

Idealot uses a number of open source projects:

* [NASA World Wind] - Free, open source API for a virtual globe
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - Javascript runtime environment
* [jQuery] - Javascript library for easy access
* [Browserify] - Use NodeJS style modules within the browser
* [jquery-csv] - CSV parser that's available in jQuery syntax style
* [NASA World Wind] - Free, open source API for a virtual globe
